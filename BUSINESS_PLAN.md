- **Mitigation**:
  - Start with personal network
  - Offer discounted portfolio projects
  - Aggressive content marketing
  - Diversify channels (LinkedIn, communities, partnerships)
  - Equity deals to reduce client risk

**2. Scope Creep Risk**
- **Risk**: Projects exceed estimated hours
- **Likelihood**: High (early on)
- **Impact**: Medium (lower margins)

  - Change requests billed separately
  - Client sign-off at each phase
  - Build buffer into estimates (20%)
  - Learn and improve estimates over time

**3. Technical Complexity Risk**
- **Risk**: Client needs exceed capabilities
- **Likelihood**: Low-Medium
- **Impact**: High (failed project)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Qualify carefully in discovery
  - Prototype risky features first
  - Bring in contractors for specialized needs
  - Have fallback options (e.g., alternative APIs)
  - Underpromise, overdeliver

**4. Competition Risk**
- **Risk**: Other agencies adopt AI, undercut pricing
- **Likelihood**: Medium (long-term)
- **Impact**: Medium (price pressure)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Focus on quality and Erlang expertise (hard to replicate)
  - Build brand and reputation
  - Diversify to retainers and equity
  - Continuous innovation
  - Community and content moat

**5. Key Person Risk**

  - Build systems, not dependencies
  - Take time off proactively
  - Maintain work-life balance

**6. Market Risk**
- **Risk**: Economic downturn reduces startup funding
- **Likelihood**: Low-Medium
- **Impact**: Medium (fewer clients)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Target multiple segments (startups + enterprise)
  - Offer flexible pricing (equity deals)
  - Retainers provide recurring revenue
  - Pivot to cost-saving narrative in downturn

**7. Technology Risk**
- **Risk**: Erlang/OTP goes out of favor
- **Likelihood**: Very Low (stable for 30+ years)
- **Impact**: Low (still works great)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Erlang is stable, not trendy
  - BEAM ecosystem growing (Elixir)
  - Focus on results, not hype
  - Can adapt stack if needed

### 7.2 Contingency Plans

**If Client Acquisition is Slow:**
- Offer free discovery calls (no commitment)
- Create "SaaS Starter Kit" product for $2K
- Do contract Erlang work to cover costs
- Partner with agencies (white-label)

**If Quality Issues Arise:**
- Extend support period at no cost
- Bring in additional QA/testing
